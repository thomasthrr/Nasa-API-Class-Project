**The Big Idea**

Main Idea: The project aims to create a web application that displays photos taken by NASA's Mars rovers. Users will be able to view the latest images sent from Mars, offering an insight into the Martian landscape and NASA's exploration efforts. Currently, space enthusiasts do not have an easy way to look for live images of the Mars Rover displayed in a variety of angles and geographical locations. Downloadable from their smartphone. So, this MVP aims to be a good to have widget space enthusiasts can rely on to get Mars rover images. 

MVP: A simple, user-friendly interface that displays live photos from the Mars rovers. The application will fetch these images directly from NASA's API. We plan to ensure that users can look at images on a 24-hour basis 

Stretch Goal: We would add features like filtering images by Martian sol (day) or by the specific rover camera. Given our understanding of python, this might be challenging, but e would want to try implementing these additional features 

**Learning Objectives**

**Shared Goals**: Learn the basics of using and leveraging APIs for a real-world utility. We will cover web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and understand the process of deploying a web application for users. 

**Individual Goals:** Thomas will focus on specific areas like frontend design and helping Shivant with the Nasa API integration and backend.  

**Implementation Plan**

Initial Tools and Frameworks: 

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

API: NASA's Mars Rover Photos API. 

Deployment: GitHub Pages or a similar platform for hosting  

Investigation Plan: Research how to effectively use NASAâ€™s APIs using python and how to deploy a static website using GitHub Pages. 

**Project Schedule** 

Week 1: Research and familiarize with NASA's API. We will start designing the UI and strategize on how to display our images 

Week 2-3: We will then go on to develop the core functionality (fetching and displaying photos). At this point in time, we will also begin frontend development. 

Week 4: By the last week (prior to December 4th), we will finalize the frontend, conduct basic testing, and deploy the application. We will also continue to debug, and if time permits, will add additional features. 

**Collaboration Plan** 

Task Division: We plan to divide tasks based on individual strengths and learning goals. For example, focusing on the API integration while the other works on the frontend design. 

Pair Programming: Regular pair programming sessions to integrate the frontend and backend. This will be conducted in-person and through online tools such as Zoom/Teams.  

Communication: Regular in person and virtual meetings and use of collaboration tools like Notion for task / roadmap tracking. 

**Risks and Limitations** 

Major Risks: Potential challenges include difficulties in understanding and integrating the NASA API, unforeseen technical issues, and time constraints. Integrating the API and debugging will probably require extra efforts and might slow us down. This is potentially the only the thing that will slow us down and prevent us from turning in a complete project 

Mitigation Strategy: We are going to allocate extra time for learning and troubleshooting. During the thanksgiving break, we plan on meeting twice an working on the project individually too. At this point in time, based on the work we have done, we might simplify the project scope if deemed necessary. 

**Additional Course Content** 

Beneficial Topics: There are many beneficial topics we can understand through this project. We plan on using additional tutorials on JavaScript, especially related to API consumption, and resources on basic web development and deployment strategies would be beneficial to the overall scope. We expect to learn a myriad of new topics/tools on the way which will help us out with our overall python understanding
